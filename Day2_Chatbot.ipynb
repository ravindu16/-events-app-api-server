            "content='Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term that refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. It involves creating computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:\\n\\n*   **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information.\\n*   **Reasoning:** Using rules to reach conclusions.\\n*   **Problem-solving:** Finding solutions to complex issues.\\n*   **Perception:** Interpreting sensory information, such as images, sounds, and text.\\n*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understanding and generating human language.\\n*   **Decision-making:** Choosing the best course of action from a set of options.\\n\\nIn simpler terms, AI aims to make computers smart enough to handle tasks that usually need a human brain.\\n\\n**Different Types of AI:**\\n\\nAI can be categorized in several ways. Here are a couple of common distinctions:\\n\\n*   **Narrow or Weak AI:** Designed and trained for a specific task. Most AI applications today fall into this category. Examples include spam filters, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.\\n*   **General or Strong AI:** Possesses human-level intelligence and can perform any intellectual task that a human being can. This type of AI is still largely theoretical.\\n\\n**Key Goals of AI:**\\n\\n*   **Automate tasks:** Reduce human effort and improve efficiency.\\n*   **Improve decision-making:** Provide data-driven insights and predictions.\\n*   **Solve complex problems:** Tackle challenges that are beyond human capabilities.\\n*   **Enhance human capabilities:** Augment human intelligence and creativity.\\n\\n**AI is rapidly evolving and has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives, from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment.**' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run--6b26711f-627b-4492-860a-8a5aeecd00b7-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9, 'output_tokens': 366, 'total_tokens': 375, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}\n"

The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values. In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT √dk )V (1) The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2],\\n\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention Multi-Head Attention Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention.

Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i. 3.2 Attention An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum 3'"
